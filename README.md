# Flift

I was a cloud
I was a cloud looking down;
Your frantic waving did not provoke feeling

But this little one-
Steady your wings, now, sparrow
I remembered him-
Steady your course, now, sparrow

And in the dark
From the sea marbled and moon-blue
Into the burning eye of the sun
Without feeling

My end was imminent-
Steady your course now, sparrow
But I remembered him-
Fear for your home life, sparrow
Fear for your home life
