        <h3>The solution is simple. Gain a mechanical advantage.</h3>
        <p>FacebookLift lets you present an appealing persona to employers, generating content that matches their highest expectations with minimal input from you.</p>
        <p>
        Where other Profile Sanitisers only offer you the option of turning all Public Posts to Friends-Only, leaving an opaque, anonymous front to employers, FacebookLift
        breaks new ground by procedurally editing all of your Public Posts for the best presentation and maximum appeal.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>FacebookLift's machine learning algorithms read your public posts and get a feeling for how you speak. After that, the app will
    ask you to approve or disapprove of a number of procedurally generated posts. When you think it's making the right choices to represent you,
    turn on Auto-Pilot and watch it populate your profile!
